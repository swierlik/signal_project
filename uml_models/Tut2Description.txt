First Ex1UMLClass.pdf:

First of all I have created 2 interfaces for both of the interfaces within our project.

After creating both interfaces I have made another node for each of the classes connected to them and then
joined them together using Inheritence line. 
(I have now realized that they should be the implementation lines instead, but I cant seem to find the file in an editable format)

In each of the nodes I have listed all their properties/attributes, and if it was a final one, I have added the {readOnly} tag to it
When describing arrays, I also used the notation of eg. int[0..*] to show it.

I then created another node showing the SimpleWebSocketServer with all of its methods and parameters as well,
which I then connected to WebSocketOutputStrategy with the Composition line since the server cant survive without
the other class. I also added 1's in the multiplicity slots since the WebSocketOutputStrategy can only hande 1 server at a time.

Finally, I finished it off by connecting almost all of our nodes with the one-way Association line to the HealthDataSimulator class.



Now StateDiagram,
much simpler than the previous simply shows how the state of the alert changes, from Generated, to test, to Acknowledged to resolved.


As for the sequence diagram, it once again gets more complicated.
We start off with our Actor, in this case being the patient since he is ultimately the one that:
A. Is the source of the alert and B. is the final step in resolving it
So our alert's journey starts at the alert generator where alarming data from the patient is sent to
The alert generator will now check wtih the DataStorage if that alarming data has been happening for a while
and is just bug(a 0.1 second massive spike due to moving an arm for example)

Now the DataStroage will return that it either is indeed a bug, at which point we automatically resolve
the alert and move on, or we find out that its an actual emergency at which case some medical staff 
should get notified so we send an alert.

Then the medical staff can manually resolve it by helping the patient or pronoucing him dead
at which point we resolve the alert.

As for the alert generation system, the graph is meant to show the connection between the 3 classes
the alert generator has methods that can decipher and compare the data its getting as well as create the initial alert
then the alert has the most essentail data however keeps it private to not break any laws
the method is protected sot hat it can still be used within the system
Finally the alert manager has a PriorityQueue setup to ensure the alerts get attended to in proper sequence
as well as a sender method to assign it to personell
