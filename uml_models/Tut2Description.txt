This is a description of my UML Class diagram for the signal project.

FIrst of all I have created 2 interfaces for both of the interfaces within our project.

After creating both interfaces I have made another node for each of the classes connected to them and then
joined them together using Inheritence line. 
(I have now realized that they should be the implementation lines instead, but I cant seem to find the file in an editable format)

In each of the nodes I have listed all their properties/attributes, and if it was a final one, I have added the {readOnly} tag to it
When describing arrays, I also used the notation of eg. int[0..*] to show it.

I then created another node showing the SimpleWebSocketServer with all of its methods and parameters as well,
which I then connected to WebSocketOutputStrategy with the Composition line since the server cant survive without
the other class. I also added 1's in the multiplicity slots since the WebSocketOutputStrategy can only hande 1 server at a time.

Finally, I finished it off by connecting almost all of our nodes with the one-way Association line to the HealthDataSimulator class.
